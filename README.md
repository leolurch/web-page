# Personal Webpage / Blog

This is the simplest way for me to build a webpage with easy cd and no extra costs (i already pay for vercel pro). 

For adding a new page I only need to create a file in the pages-markdown directory, put in some content, commit and push my changes to github. The rest is done by vercel.

This project is based on an [example in the next-markdown repo](https://github.com/frouo/next-markdown/tree/02d93bc3703ed0510007126023ab3cf0c68c6a1d/examples/personal-blog).
