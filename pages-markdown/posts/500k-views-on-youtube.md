# Lessons learned from creating content

## Key takeaways
- quality is king
- video and auido quality don't matter that much

The best performing video, when it comes to views is one of our more boring ones. It's a tutorial on how to build your (first) go-kart.

Even though this video did pretty well, we decided that we wanted to produce more engaging videos like everyone is telling you, when you get started.

The core audience liked the boring stuff though.

Sometimes boring is king.
