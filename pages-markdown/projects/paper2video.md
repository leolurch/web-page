# Paper 2 Video

## Abstract
We are attempting to create a pipeline that takes an [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) paper id as input and produces a 3-5 minute video explaining the key findings and concepts covered in the paper.

## Results
- [First generated video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/187RRSpiGjapQKbFUpF9pGO8YjjTTZsS3/view) - The video is too long, contains seemingly random stock images, and features an attractive voice.

## Build Space
We are part of the current Build Space batch (S23), which immediately granted us access to 100k in ElevenLabs credits - highly recommended.

## Tech Stack
- Python 
- LangChain 
- ElevenLabs / Google Text to Speech (for development testing)
- MoviePy - for content combination
- Manim - for generating animations Ã  la 3b1b
- Pexels - free stock video library
