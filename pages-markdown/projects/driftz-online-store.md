# e-comm store for our youtube channel

we were already selling diy gokart related products on our [ebay store](https://www.ebay.de/usr/driftz.eu?_trksid=p4429486.m3561.l161211), when we decided, that we don't want to pay the 15 - 20% ebay commission anymore. so i sat down and started my first ever sveltekit project. and i have to admit, that it has a great dev experience. comming from react, i was used to a solid amount of boilerplate. you just feel much faster in svelte(-kit). 

i used the following tech-stack:
- shopify
- sveltekit
- graphql
- tailwind
- vercel

# concept
the page should however not only be a store, but a platform around our youtube channel. i build an engine to easily add calculation tools, that you might need in the future and 

# after it was build
... we decided to quit aktively making videos and focus on our "professional" life. so the store only had around 15 sales till now. 

# start lean
if i'd take on one of these projects myself, i'd go much leaner from the beginning and not build a whole frontend myself without validating the efficiency of the customer aquisition funnels.

# links
the store could go offline in the future, 'cause it doesn't make sense to pay for shopify, order + process stock and do the fullfillment, if you barely have sales.

you might be lucky anyway
