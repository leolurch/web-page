# E-Comm Store for Our YouTube Channel

We were already selling DIY go-kart related products on our [eBay store](https://www.ebay.de/usr/driftz.eu?_trksid=p4429486.m3561.l161211), when we decided that we didn't want to pay the 15 - 20% eBay commission anymore. So, I sat down and started my first ever SvelteKit project. I have to admit, it offers a great development experience. Coming from React, I was used to a significant amount of boilerplate. You just feel much faster in Svelte(-Kit). 

I used the following tech-stack:
- Shopify
- SvelteKit
- GraphQL
- Tailwind
- Vercel

# Concept

The page should not only be a store, but a platform around our YouTube channel. I built an engine to easily add calculation tools that you might need in the future.

# After It Was Built
... we decided to quit actively making videos and focus on our "professional" life. So, the store only had around 15 sales till now. 

# Start Lean
If I were to take on one of these projects myself, I'd go much leaner from the beginning and not build a whole frontend myself without validating the efficiency of the customer acquisition funnels.

# Links
The store might go offline in the future, because it doesn't make sense to pay for Shopify, order and process stock, and do the fulfillment if you barely have sales.

You might be lucky anyway
