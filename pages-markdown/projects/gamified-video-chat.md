# Video Chat Platform for Non-Profit

Together with [Dominik Scherm](https://twitter.com/dominik_scherm), I built a video chat platform that included card games.

Key Takeaways
- [Twilio Video Chat](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video) had poor performance at the time of building.
- [100ms](https://www.100ms.live/) delivered both superior production video quality and a better development experience.

Unfortunately, the project never saw the light of day, aside from a few internal test sessions and a demo with PepsiCo. During the demo, the Twilio version collapsed, and I had to start a hotfix session after working through the night. 

## Tech Stack
- Twilio / 100ms
- Firebase
- Next.js
- Tailwind
