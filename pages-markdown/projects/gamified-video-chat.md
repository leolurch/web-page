# video chat platform for non-profit

together with [dominik scherm](https://twitter.com/dominik_scherm) i build a video chat platform. that included card games

key takeaways
- [twilio video chat](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video) had bad performance at the time of building
- [100ms](https://www.100ms.live/) delivered both a better production video quality + better dev experience

sadly the project never saw the daylight aside from a few internal test sessions and a demo with pepsico where the twilio version collapsed and i had to start a hotfix session after working through the night (:
